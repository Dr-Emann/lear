# Lear: An Annoying Command Line Tool

Lear is a command line &ldquo;tool&rdquo; that you can use to annoy yourself and your friends. Whenever you mistype `clear` into the terminal, `lear` will dutifully print out a passage from everyone&rsquo;s favorite tragedy about a mad king.

This idea was loosely inspired by [`sl` (Steam Locomotive)](https://github.com/mtoyoda/sl), [Fortune](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_(Unix)>), and all of the other weird command line scripts out there.
